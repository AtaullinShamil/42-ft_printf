### The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.

## Function prototype
```C
int	ft_printf(const char *str, ...)
```
## I have implemented the following conversions:
+ %c Prints a single character.
+ %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
+ %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
+ %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
+ %i Prints an integer in base 10.
+ %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
+ %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
+ %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
+ %% Prints a percent sign.
